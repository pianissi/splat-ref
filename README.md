## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to the [WebGL2 Fundamentals](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/) page and [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/), without which I would have no clue how to implement this project, as well as Andrew Adamson whose video tutorials I followed.

## Demo

The frontend is deployed on Vercel: [https://splat-ref.vercel.app](https://splat-ref.vercel.app).
